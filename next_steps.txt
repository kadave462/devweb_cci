the next step from your instructions, they're asking you to:

Modify the testRanking method in SoccerControllerTest to verify that team names in the ranking page are displayed as links to their respective team pages.
Update the ranking.html template to make team names clickable links to their team pages.

Specifically, you need to:

Update the assertions in testRanking to expect HTML links instead of plain text team names.

Change from looking for plain text "Marseille" to looking for <a href="/team/[teamId0]">Marseille</a>
Change from looking for plain text "Paris" to looking for <a href="/team/[teamId1]">Paris</a>


Run the test and verify it fails (because the current template doesn't have these links).
Modify the ranking.html template to change how team names are displayed:

Replace the current team name column (likely using th:text="${row.team().name()}")
With a link using: <a th:href="@{'/team/' + ${row.team().id()}}" th:text="${row.team().name()}"></a>


Run the test again to verify it now passes.
Run the application and manually verify that:

Team names appear as clickable links in the ranking table
Clicking these links takes you to the correct team page


Commit and push your changes to the repository.

This step is about enhancing the user experience by making the ranking table interactive,
allowing users to click on team names to see their detailed information.
